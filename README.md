# SQL Data Analysis & Data Cleaning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL-based data analysis and data cleaning projects. The work demonstrates core data analyst skills including database creation, data preparation, exploratory analysis, and query writing using structured SQL scripts.

The projects focus on transforming raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets and extracting insights using SQL queries.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational Databases
- CSV Data Sources
- GitHub

## Repository Contents

### SQL Scripts
- **Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql**  
  Creates database tables and schema for analysis.

- **Data Cleaning.sql**  
  Cleans raw data by handling duplicates, standardizing values, and preparing datasets for analysis.

- **Exploring Data.sql**  
  Performs exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to understand distributions, trends, and key metrics.

- **Select Statement.sql**  
  Demonstrates core SQL concepts including SELECT statements, filtering, sorting, and aggregations.

- **Query 1.sql**  
  Contains analytical queries designed to answer business-related questions using SQL.

### Dataset
- **layoffs.csv**  
  Raw dataset used for analysis, containing company layoff data across industries and time periods.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Writing optimized SQL SELECT queries
- Data cleaning and transformation using SQL
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Working with real-world datasets
- Structuring SQL projects for reproducibility

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset (`layoffs.csv`) into a SQL database
2. Run `Parks_and_Rec_Create_db.sql` to create required tables
3. Execute `Data Cleaning.sql` to prepare the data
4. Use `Exploring Data.sql`, `Select Statement.sql`, and `Query 1.sql` to perform analysis and extract insights

## Use Case
These projects simulate real-world data analyst tasks such as cleaning messy data, exploring trends, and answering business questions using SQL.
